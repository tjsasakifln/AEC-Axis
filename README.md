## üèóÔ∏è **Overview**

**AEC Axis** is a revolutionary SaaS platform that transforms construction supply chain management from a reactive cost center into a proactive source of competitive advantage. Our solution directly addresses the **$1.6 trillion blind spot** of the construction industry: the archaic interface between design, procurement, and logistics.

### **The Problem**
- **80% of time** of Supply Chain Managers is wasted on manual quantity extraction tasks
- Fragmented and inefficient quotation processes
- Lack of integration between BIM models and procurement
- Purchase decisions based on incomplete and outdated information

### **Our Solution**
The **BIM-to-Quotation Connector** completely automates the flow from material extraction from IFC files to intelligent quotation comparison, reducing **80% of time** spent on these critical activities.
